However, we believed we could do much more than just seating arrangements.</span></span>

				<span id="col2">Our current intent is to make an all-in-one wedding planning app that would be able to, having been given the budget for the wedding, make suggestions for various services, such as catering, venue booking, or floral arrangements, so as to best fit the provided budget. Our seating arrangement planner will only be a component of this application. In regards to service suggestion, we could provide other details for each given service provider, with the intent being to help our customers get weddings planned out to be under budget and ahead of schedule.</span>
